# Object Detection, Recognition and Segmentation
 
This is the repository of the Group 9 composed by Mar Ferrer (mar.ferrerf@e-campus.uab.cat), Alex Tempelaar (alexander.tempelaar@e-campus.uab.cat), and VÃ­ctor Ubieto (victor.ubieto@e-campus.uab.cat).

In this project we provide a nice implementation of a Image Classification network using the framework from Pytorch.

You can find the final documentation and report of the whole project [here](https://).

# Code Explanation

This code is a Pytorch implementation of an image classiffier based on CNNs. The used model is extracted from a previous module (M3) in which we worked with Keras. So the aim of this project is to spot the differences between the two frameworks. 
In order to run this code, you have to do the following:

1. Open the main file, lab1.py, and insert your path for the training set: DATASET_DIR_TRAIN: --Line 18
2. Insert your path for the training set: DATASET_DIR_TEST: --Line 19
3. Run: >> python lab1.py
